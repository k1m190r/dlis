<H3><A name="2">2 - Data Organization</A></H3>
<H4><A name="2_1">2.1 Scope of the Standard</A></H4>The Digital  Log Interchange 
Standard defines data organization on two levels,  on the <EM>Logical 
Format</EM> level and  on the <EM>Physical Format</EM> level.   The Logical 
Format concerns the syntactic and semantic organization  of a sequence of data 
characters.  The Physical Format concerns  the location and physical 
organization of data on various media. 
<P>The Logical Format is embedded in a Physical Format,  but the two formats are 
very loosely bound to support reasonable  access efficiency without unduly 
constraining the elements of the  Logical Format.  Consequently, before an 
application on a given  system can process DLIS data recorded on a given medium, 
it must 
<UL>
  <LI> understand the Logical Format of the data, and  
  <LI> be able to map elements between the Logical       Format and the Physical 
  Format. </LI></UL>
<H4><A name="2_2">2.2 Logical Format</A></H4>The DLIS  Logical Format consists 
of the following elements: 
<UL>
  <LI> the <EM>Logical Record</EM>, a group of 8-bit       bytes or data 
  characters  
  <LI> the <EM>Logical File</EM>, a group of related Logical Records. </LI></UL>
<P>The relationship and ordering of these elements  is illustrated in Figure 
2-1.  At the byte level, DLIS data is an  ordered stream of 8-bit bytes, in 
which byte k precedes byte k+1.  Within each byte, bit 1 is the high-order bit. 
<P align="CENTER"><IMG width="550" height="237" src="Chapter%202%20-%20Data%20Organization_files/image175.gif"> 
  <BR><B>Figure 2-1. Logical Format</B> 
<H5><A name="2_2_1">2.2.1 Representation Codes</A></H5>Each distinct piece of 
information in the Logical Format  has a well-defined representation  that 
extends across one or more bytes.   All permissible representations  are listed 
in Appendix B both by symbolic name and by the one-byte  <EM>Representation 
Code</EM> used to designate the representation  explicitly in the Logical 
Format. 
<P>Symbolic names of the Representation Codes are  provided for use in this 
specification.  It is likely that these  names will correspond to identifiers in 
program code, and they are  restricted to six characters for this reason.  A 
two-byte signed  integer quantity, then, is said to have Representation Code 
SNORM,  whereas a single precision floating point number has Representation 
 Code FSINGL, a variable-length string of text has Representation  Code ASCII, 
and so on. 
<H5><A name="2_2_2">2.2.2 Logical Record (LR)</A></H5>Logical  Records form the 
basic coherent bodies of information in the DLIS  Logical Format.  They 
encapsulate semantically related information  within a Logical File.  Each 
Logical Record consists of one or more  consecutive <I>Logical Record 
Segments</I>, which provide the interface  between the Logical Format and the 
Physical Format.  Logical Record  Segmentation is dependent on the type of 
Physical Format. 
<P>For example, it is the responsibility of the  Logical Record Segments, not 
the Logical Records, to align with  Physical Format boundaries.  Segmentation 
also permits processing  Logical Records of indefinite length. 
<P>A Logical Record Segment is composed of four  mutually disjoint parts: 
<UL>
  <LI> a <I>Logical Record Segment Header</I>, 
  <LI> an optional <EM>Logical Record Segment Encryption Packet</EM>, 
  <LI> a <EM>Logical Record Segment Body</EM>, and 
  <LI> an optional <EM>Logical Record Segment Trailer</EM>. </LI></UL>The term 
"Logical Record" distinguishes  the DLIS element from a physical disk or tape 
record. 
<H6><A name="2_2_2_1">2.2.2.1 Logical Record Segment Header (LRSH)</A></H6>Each 
Logical  Record Segment begins with a Logical Record Segment Header.  The  LRSH 
format is defined in Figure 2-2. 
<P>Where information in the LRSH applies to a Logical  Record, rather than to a 
Logical Record Segment, that information  must be used consistently in all 
Segments of a Logical Record.   Redundant recording of such information permits 
a uniform structure  for the LRSH and provides knowledge about the Logical 
Record (e.g.,  what kind of information has been lost) that may not be otherwise 
 available if, for example, the first Logical Record Segment is damaged.

  <LI><A name="Figure_2_2_Comment_1">1. </A> The <EM>Logical Record Segment 
  Length</EM> is a two-byte, unsigned integer (Representation Code UNORM) that 
   specifies the length, in bytes, of the Logical Record Segment. The Logical 
  Record Segment Length is required  to be even.  The even length ensures that 
  2-byte checksums can be  computed, when present, and permits some operating 
  systems to handle  DLIS data more efficiently without degrading performance 
  with other  systems.  There is no limitation on a Logical Record length.
   Logical Record Segments must contain at least  sixteen (16) bytes.  This 
  requirement facilitates mapping the Logical  Format to those Physical Formats 
  that require a minimum physical  record length.

  Segments of a Logical Record. 
  <LI><A name="Figure_2_3_Comment_2">2. </A> The <EM>Predecessor</EM> bit 
  indicates whether  this is the first Segment in the Logical Record.   If the

  <U>is</U> set, then this is not the last Segment. 
  <LI><A name="Figure_2_3_Comment_4">4. </A> The <EM>Encryption </EM>bit 
  indicates whether  the Logical Record Segment Body and Pad Bytes (see comment 
  8) are  encrypted.  This bit must be applied the same way in all Segments  of 
  a Logical Record.  In particular, encryption is applied at the  Logical Record 
  level and, therefore, cannot result in encryption  of only part of a Logical 
  Record Body.  Logical Record Segment Headers,  Encryption Packets (see comment 
  5), checksums (see comment 6), and  Trailing Lengths (see comment 7) are never 
  encrypted.  Pad Bytes  are included when encryption is applied to allow for 
  encryption  algorithms that require a minimum number of bytes or certain 
  multiples  of bytes. Encryption is used by an organization to  record 
  information that is considered proprietary. 
  <LI><A name="Figure_2_3_Comment_5">5. </A> The <EM>Encryption Packet </EM>bit 
  indicates  whether there is an Encryption Packet in the Logical Record 
  Segment.  The Encryption Packet bit may not be set unless the Encryption  bit 
  is also set.  It <U>must</U> be set in the first Segment of  a Logical Record 
  whenever the Encryption bit is set.  It is optional  otherwise. Section 
  2.2.2.2 describes the location, contents  and use of the Encryption Packet. 
  <LI><A name="Figure_2_3_Comment_6">6. </A> The <EM>Checksum</EM> bit indicates 
  whether  there is a checksum in the Logical Record Segment Trailer (LRST). 
  <LI><A name="Figure_2_3_Comment_7">7. </A> The <I>Trailing Length</I> bit 
  indicates  whether there is a copy of the Logical Record Segment Length in 
   the LRST.  This bit must be applied the same way in all Logical  Record 
  Segments of a Logical File.  In particular, all Logical Record  Segments in a 
  Logical File must have Trailing Lengths or none have  them.  This requirement 
  exists to permit traversal of a Logical  File in a backward direction. 
  <LI><A name="Figure_2_3_Comment_8">8. </A> The <I>Padding</I> bit indicates 
  the presence  of <I>Pad Bytes</I> and a <I>Pad Count</I> in the LRST.  If 
  Padding  is present, the Pad Count is a single byte (Representation Code 
   USHORT) that contains a count of Pad Bytes present in the LRST.  The Pad 
  Count is considered one of the Pad Bytes, so the Pad Count  may have the value 
  1.  The remaining Pad Bytes, if any, immediately  precede the Pad Count in the 
  LRST.  The Pad Count precedes the checksum  and the Trailing Length when these 
  are present. Padding is a transparent mechanism for achieving  minimum Logical 
  Record Segment size and even Logical Record Segment  length when these 
  conditions would not otherwise occur.  Pad Bytes,  other than the Pad Count, 
  have no meaning, and their values are  arbitrary. </LI></UL>

<H5><A name="2_2_3">2.2.3 Logical File (LF)</A></H5>A Logical  File consists of 
a sequence of one or more Logical Records, beginning  with a <I>File Header 
Logical Record </I> (FHLR, see §5.1 and Appendix  A), and containing no other 
FHLRs.  A Logical File is terminated  when another FHLR is encountered or when 
no more Logical Records  are available for the Logical File. 
<P>The term "Logical File" distinguishes  the DLIS element from a physical disk 
or tape file. 
<P>
<H6><A name="2_2_3_1">2.2.3.1 File Header Logical Record (FHLR)</A></H6>Any FHLR 
 must consist of exactly one Logical Record Segment.  It is useful  to be able 
to handle an FHLR as a file label, and this is one of  the requirements 
necessary to make that possible. 
<H4><A name="2_3">2.3 Physical Format</A></H4>Physical Format is the way in 
which recorded data is located and organized  on a physical medium, such as a 
magnetic tape or disk.  The specific  binding of Logical Format to Physical 
Format depends on the medium  and the access mechanism. 
<P>This section defines bindings for <I>Record-Structured</I> Physical Formats, 
including the industry-standard 9-track magnetic  tapes as a special case.  
Bindings for other Physical Formats are  not defined here.</P>
<H5><A name="2_3_1">2.3.1 Terminology</A></H5>The term  <I>Storage Unit</I> is 
defined loosely as something that contains  recorded data and that is manageable 
as a unit at the human level.  When applied to magnetic tape, Storage Unit 
refers to a single  physical reel of tape.  When applied to disks, Storage Unit 
refers  to a single file.  The term is used only when no distinction between 
 different media is intended; the common terms "tape" and  "file" are used when 
the context is targeted strictly  at magnetic tapes or at disk files, 
respectively.
<P></P>
<P align="JUSTIFY">A sequence of Logical Files can reside on a single  Storage 
Unit or a single Logical File can span multiple Storage  Units.  When a Logical 
File begins on one Storage Unit and ends  on another, the Storage Units that it 
intersects constitute part  of a <I>Storage Set</I>.  Further definition of a 
Storage Set is  provided in §2.3.4, "Storage Set Requirements." 
<P>All access mechanisms apply a structure to data  recorded on a Storage Unit.  
The following structure is covered  in this specification: 
<UL>
  <LI><EM>Sequential Record Structure</EM> permits  access to data in 
  sequential, variable-length records.  Records  must be written sequentially in 
  a forward direction, but can be  read sequentially in either a forward or 
  backward direction, either  directly or by backspacing over a record and then 
  reading it in  a forward direction.  A Storage Unit on which the Physical 
  Format  has been written with a Sequential Record Structure is called a  
  <EM>Record Storage Unit</EM>. </LI></UL>A Physical Format can be partitioned 
into three  mutually disjoint parts: the Logical Format, the <I>Invisible 
Envelope</I>,  and the <I>Visible Envelope</I>, respectively.  These parts are 
 illustrated in Figure 2-6.  The Logical Format is data that is of  interest to 
applications.  The Invisible Envelope is data that is  managed by the access 
mechanism and is not part of normal data read  and write transactions.  
Invisible Envelope data is typically part  of the control interface between the 
access mechanism and applications  or is available through special queries.  For 
example, most disk  operating systems maintain file header control information 
that  is separate from the file data.  Record Structure files can also  contain 
record lengths that are passed as control between the operating  system and the 
application but are not passed as data.  The Visible  Envelope is information 
that is passed as data and is important  in defining a particular Physical 
Format, but data that is not part  of the Logical Format. 
<P>Except for industry-standard magnetic tapes,  a specification of the 
Invisible Envelope is beyond the scope of  this document.

  Minor version numbers  begin at 00 and increase sequentially through 01, 
  02,..., 99.  All  Logical Files on the Storage Unit adhere to the major 
  version and  to the same or smaller minor version.

<H5><A name="2_3_4">2.3.4 Storage Set Requirements</A></H5>A Storage  Set was 
introduced in §2.3.1 as a group of Storage Units across  at least two of which 
resides a single Logical File.  With the introduction  of an SUL, it is now 
possible to complete the definition of Storage  Set.  A Storage Set is a group 
of one or more Storage Units that  satisfies the following conditions: 
<UL>
  <LI>All Storage Units have the same Structure. 
  <LI>The Storage Set Identifier field in the  SUL is identical for all Storage 
  Units. 
  <LI>The set of Storage Unit Sequence Numbers  in the SULs form the sequence 1, 
  2, 3, ..., n, where n is the number  of Storage Units in the Storage Set. 
  <LI>The Storage Set contains a single Logical  Format, which is partitioned 
  sequentially into n parts.  For any  k, part k is contained in Storage Unit k. 
  </LI></UL>The Storage Set is provided to cover situations  in which a Logical 
File overflows a Storage Unit and must be continued  on another.  This typically 
need only occur with magnetic tapes,  although it is permitted to occur with any 
type of Storage Unit.  Notice, however, that the actual requirements stated 
above do not  demand Logical File continuation across members of a Storage Set, 
 neither do they demand that the Storage Set Identifier be distinct  for all 
Storage Sets.  The implementation of Storage Sets and Storage  Set Identifiers 
is left to users who shall decide how they can best  suit the users' needs. 
<H5><A name="2_3_5">2.3.5 Storage Unit Terminators</A></H5>A Storage  Unit may 
simply run out of data, which is one way for it to terminate.
<P></P>On industry standard 9-track magnetic tapes a  Storage Unit is terminated 
by two consecutive Tape Marks (see §2.3.7.1).  These marks belong to the 
Invisible Envelope of the tape.

application as a result of a normal record read operation.  
<P>On a Record Storage Unit, each Visible Record  other than those in the 
Invisible Envelope or those that contain  a Storage Unit Label must contain a 
positive integer number of Logical  Record Segments, and all Segments must 
belong to the same Logical  File.  That is, a Logical Record Segment cannot span 
Visible Records  and Visible Records cannot intersect more than one Logical 
File. 
<P>This requirement permits a DLIS reader always  to locate the beginning of the 
next Logical Record on the Storage  Unit.  If Trailing Lengths are recorded, it 
permits backward recovery  of Logical Record Segments when the first Logical 
Record Segment  Length in the Visible Record is damaged. 
<H6><A name="2_3_6_1">2.3.6.1 Visible Record Length</A></H6>According  to 
sections 2.3.1 and 2.3.6, a Visible Record consists of Visible  Envelope data 
plus one or more Logical Record Segments.  Other than  the Storage Unit Label, a 
Visible Record on a Record Storage Unit  must contain the following parts in the 
order described: 
<UL>
  <LI> A <I>Visible Record Length</I>, expressed  in terms of Representation 
  Code UNORM (part of the Visible Envelope)  
  <LI> A two-byte <I>Format Version Field</I> (part  of the Visible Envelope, 
  see section 2.3.6.2)  
  <LI> One or more complete Logical Record Segments      (part of the Logical

bytes of these three parts. 
<H6><A name="2_3_6_2">2.3.6.2 Format Version</A></H6>Following  the Visible 
Record Length in each Visible Record is a two-byte field,  called the <I>Format 
Version</I>.  This belongs to the Visible Envelope.  The first byte is FF (hex), 
which distinguishes the Visible Record  from records of other, older formats.  
The second byte is an integer  (USHORT) specifying the major version number of 
the format, which  for this specification is the value 1. 
<H6><A name="2_3_6_3">2.3.6.3 Visible Envelope</A></H6>For a Storage  Set 
consisting of Record Storage Units, the Visible Envelope consists  of

<H6><A name="2_3_6_4">2.3.6.4 Minimum Visible Record Length</A></H6>No explicit 
 minimum record length is required.  Note that Logical Record Segments  must be 
at least 16 bytes long.  When the Visible Record Length  and Format Version are 
included, the combination yields an implicit  minimum length of 20 bytes, which 
is sufficient for known devices  to handle.

Visible Record Length permitted on a Record  Storage Unit is 16,384  bytes. 
<j5><A name="2_3_7">2.3.7 Industry-Standard 9-Track Magnetic Tape</A> No 
constraint  is imposed on the type of magnetic media that a company uses to 
 record DLIS information for its private use.  However, any standard  DLIS tape 
access utility may be required to read or write DLIS information  recorded only 
on industry-standard 9-track tapes that are written  at a density of 800, 1600, 
or 6250 bits per inch. 
<P>To ensure uniformity of access to tape, which  is a removable medium, the 
Invisible Envelope of a Physical Format  that is recorded on industry-standard 
9-track magnetic tape.; must  consist of physical tape marks.  The complete 
Physical Format encountered  on such a tape, then, consists of tape marks, 
Storage Unit Label,  Visible Record Lengths, Format Versions, and Logical Record 
Segments.  This is illustrated in Figure 2-8.  The use of tape marks is 
described  in "Physical Tape Marks," which is the following section.

<H6><A name="2_3_7_1">2.3.7.1 Physical Tape Marks</A></H6>Physical tape marks 
constitute the Invisible Envelope on industry-standard  9-track magnetic tapes.  
Such tapes contain two indelible marks,  called BOT and ETW in Figure 2-8.  BOT 
is near the physical beginning  of the tape and indicates the start of the 
region in which recorded  information is permitted.  ETW is required to be a 
minimum distance  from the physical end of the tape and serves as a warning; 
with  many systems ETW can be sensed only when writing. 
<P>Industry-standard 9-track magnetic tapes also  employ a form of tape mark 
which is not indelible and that can appear  multiple times.  Marks of this type 
are called TM in Figure 2-8.  A TM is a distinct form of recorded information 
and takes the place  of a physical record.  When an industry-standard 9-track 
magnetic  tape serves as a Storage Unit, the TM shall be used as follows: 
<UL>
  <LI>There shall be a single TM following the  BOT and immediately preceding 
  the Storage Unit Label.  When reading  a tape, any information found between 
  the BOT and the first TM shall  be discarded as "noise" attributable to the 
  mechanical  variation in recording devices.  The Storage Unit Label shall be 
   the first record on the tape following the first TM. 
  <LI>There shall be at least two consecutive  TMs following the last of the 
  Logical Format or the Visible Envelope  information that is recorded on tape.  
  Two consecutive TMs function  as a Storage Unit Terminator. 
  <LI>Exactly one TM shall separate the first  Visible Record of a Logical File 
  from any preceding Logical Format  or Visible Envelope information. </LI></UL>
